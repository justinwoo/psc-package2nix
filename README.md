# Psc-Package2Nix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix)

Tool to derive a Nix expression from a `psc-package.json` configuration.

Prefetches Git SHA of the total dependencies you depend on.

Read the blog post about this project here: <https://qiita.com/kimagure/items/85a64437f9af78398638>

There's also a post about this whole setup (going from Bower): <https://qiita.com/kimagure/items/aec640d0047d08d2ce90>

I (Justin) gave a talk about Psc-Package2Nix: <https://speakerdeck.com/justinwoo/nix-ify-your-psc-package-dependencies>

## Usage example

### `default.nix`

In the [test](./test) setup, we have the `packages.nix` that is generated by `psc-package2nix` checked in, so you can see what kind of file we are generating here.

Then when you look at `default.nix`, you will find that we have a normal derivation, where...

First, we use [easy-purescript-nix](https://github.com/justinwoo/easy-purescript-nix) to easily install the PureScript compiler and Psc-Package. This expression takes an argument should you wish to override `pkgs`, but this will default to using `<nixpkgs>`.

```nix
# easy-purs.nix

# this line means that this expression can take a "pkgs" argument, but will default to `import <nixpkgs> {}`
# You can check the nixpkgs content from the repl yourself with `nixpkgs = ./import <nixpkgs> {}`
# Remember that <nixpkgs> corresponds to channels you have declared in ~/.nix-channels, e.g.
# https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

# import the nix expression provided by a source, in this case being a derivation with its `src` contents being the repo contents
import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
  owner = "justinwoo";
  repo = "easy-purescript-nix";

  # some commit SHA or tag name
  rev = "5b71ea53e25a1f99229ee0b657b37c46f6fc0a45";

  # some SHA of the contents, obtained by nix-prefetch-git/prefetch-github/etc
  sha256 = "1qza198b93abr4klzvz55ccai99ji893j4kgv0dali827ryk7ph2";
})
```

Then, we bring in `psc-package2nix` from this repository remotely.

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # here we use the derivation defined above to import easy-ps:
  easy-ps = import ./easy-ps.nix { inherit pkgs; };

  psc-package2nix = import ./psc-package2nix.nix { inherit pkgs; };

in pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "test";
  buildInputs = [
    easy-ps.inputs.purs
    easy-ps.inputs.psc-package-simple
    psc-package2nix
  ];
}
```

With this, we can start up a nix-shell that runs `psc-package2nix` to generate `packages.nix` of our Psc-Package dependencies.

### `install-deps.nix`

Then we have a separate `install-deps.nix` file which uses the generated `packages.nix` file.  We bring in the packages that have been generated here and create a list using the attribute values of the set (reminder: records are called "attribute sets" in Nixlang).

The list we prepare wil be a series of copy commands for the Psc-Package dependencies to be copied from the Nix Store, which will give us local mutable copies in `.psc-package/`. We can accomplish this with an executable `install-deps.nix` file:

```nix
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell ./install-deps.nix --run 'exit'
# ^ this second line determines how install-deps.nix is called by nix-shell

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

let
  # import our packages
  packages = import ./packages.nix { inherit pkgs; };

  # you will want to fetch this likely by direct url or copy this into your project
  # _pp2n-utils = import pkgs.fetchurl {
  #   url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinwoo/psc-package2nix/SOMEREV/utils.nix";
  #   sha = "SOMESHA";
  # };

  # import pp2n-utils from the psc-package2nix derivation in easy-ps
  # easy-ps = import ./easy-ps.nix { inherit pkgs; };
  # pp2n-utils = import (easy-ps.inputs.psc-package2nix.src + "/utils.nix");

  # get the utilities defined in utils.nix in this repo for getting a default shell hook to copy dependencies
  pp2n-utils = import ../utils.nix;

# use the mkInstallPackages function to generate a shell derivation to install derivation
in pp2n-utils.mkInstallPackages pkgs packages
```

Of course, you might use the full power of the Nix language to tweak this to fit your uses, but this should work for many uses.
